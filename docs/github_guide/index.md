# GitHub Guide

An organization can use GitHub to maintain their configuration templates. GitHub provides many useful collaboration
features which can allow to align company requirements with the automation process workflow.

Such features are Pull Request, review and approval procedures, protected branches and action workflows.

In the [Development section](github_workflow.md), a general workflow will be introduced. It can be used as a baseline
process for any future expanded workflows.

!!! danger
    It is highly recommended to use Enterprise GitHub to avoid accidental leakage of the configuration to the public!
