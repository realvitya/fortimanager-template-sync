# Welcome to Fortinet Template Sync

This project is to support maintaining CLI provision templates in a GIT repository and automatically keep it in sync
with Fortimanager and the managed firewalls.

The intended workflow of how to develop CLI provision templates in a collaboration tool like GitHub is detailed in the
[GitHub workflow guide](github_guide/github_workflow.md)

You can read more on how to set up your test environment at the
[lab setup guide](user_guide/lab_setup.md#lab-setup-guide).
